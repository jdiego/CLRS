### Exercises 8.2-1
***
Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of COUNTING-SORT on the array A = [6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2].

### Exercises 8.2-2
***
Prove that COUNTING-SORT is stable.

### `Answer`
It inserts the last occurrence in the originally unsorted array in the last possible position
for that particular value. Future occurrences of that same value cannot be located but
before the next occurrence of that value in the input array.

In the final for loop an element equal to one taken from A earlier is placed before the 
earlier one (i.e., at a lower index position) in the output arrray B. The original 
algorithm was stable because an element taken from A later started out with a lower 
index than one taken earlier. 

### Exercises 8.2-3
***
Suppose that the for loop header in line 9 of the COUNTING-SORT procedure is rewritten 

as 9 for j ← 1 to length[A]

Show that the algorithm still works properly. Is the modified algorithm stable?

### `Answer`

The modified algorithm is not stable, though it works properly. No matter how j runs 
from 1 or from length[A], the correctness of the algorithm will not be affected. 
Because C[0..k] is well established. When index j is running from 1 to length[A], 
the element which is taken from A earlier is put in B at later index. 
It violates the stable property. 

For example, suppose that there are two elements A1 and A2 with the same value, and A1 appears before
A2 in the input array. In the original algorithm, if A1 is put into the output array B at
position x, then A2 will be put into x + 1 position. But, in the modified algorithm, A2
is put into x position and A1 into x+1 position. They are reversed in the output. For the
purpose of sorting, the reverse is ok because A1 = A2. So the modified algorithm works
properly but isn't stable. 
### Exercises 8.2-4
***
Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range 0 to k, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the n integers fall into a range [a...b] in O(1) time. Your algorithm should use Θ(n + k) preprocessing time.

### `Answer`
Use line 1 to 7 of the counting-sort algorithm presented at pp. 168 to preprocess
the n integers in the range 0 to k.

After the preprocessing, we have an array C[0..k] in which each C[i] contains the number 
of integers less than or equal to i. This preprocess takes theta(n+k) time. Let Query(a,b)
be an algorithm to return the number of the n integers faill into a range [a..b] in O(1)
time. The code for query is as follows.
