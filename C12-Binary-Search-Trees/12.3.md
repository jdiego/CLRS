### Exercises 12.3-2
***
Suppose that a binary search tree is constructed by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. 
Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value(Ns) in the tree is one plus the number of 
nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree(Ni).

### `Answer`
多检查一次是否相等.

When insert a node x into a BST at the depth of h, we have to compare h nodes. So Ni = h.
Weh we search for a node x in a BST, assuming that target node is at the depth of h, we have to 
compare h time to find the right branch, and at last to compare the node at the branch with node x.
The examined nodes Ns are totally h + 1.


### Exercises 12.3-3
***
We can sort a given set of n numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers 
(using TREE-INSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by 
an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

### `Answer`
退化成链表就是最坏情况.

The algorithm is simple: for each element in the set of n number, call insert passing the i-nth element.
After that, call inorder procedure

If it's Degenerated into a list, then the worst situation.

The worst case: O(N^2): when the input set of data is already sorted, thus the insert operation results a linear linked chain.
The best case: O(NlogN):when the BST is strictly balanced -- for input set with n items, the height of the resulted BST is 
log N.


### Exercises 12.3-4
Suppose that another data structure contains a pointer to a node y in a binary search tree, and suppose that y's predecessor 
z is deleted from the tree by the procedure TREE-DELETE. What problem can arise? How can TREE-DELETE be rewritten 
to solve this problem?
### `Answer`
当要删除的节点有两个子节点时，节点y会被删除. 如果指向的是节点y,那么就出问题的.在这种情况下应该修改成指向节点z.

If the node being deleted has two child nodes, then y will be deleted. If the pointer point to y, there will be problem. Under such situation, the pointer should point to node z.


### Exercises 12.3-5
***
Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting x and then y from a binary search tree leaves the 
same tree as deleting y and then x? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

### `Answer`
NO.

### Exercises 12.3-5-b
*Suppose that instead of each node x keeping the attribute x:p, pointing to x’s parent, 
it keeps x:succ, pointing to x’s successor. Give pseudocode for SEARCH, INSERT, and 
DELETE on a binary search tree T using this representation. These procedures should operate 
in time O(h), where h is the height of the tree T . (Hint: You may wish to implement a subroutine 
that returns the parent of a node.)

### `Answer`

LEMMA: To find the parent of node x, we should find the maximum key M in the subtree rooted by
x first. Then, we go downward to the right from M.succ.left. When we reach x, the node we
encounter before X is x'parent.

If node M is the maximum of the subtree rooted at X, then M must have no right child, hence
M.succ is the first ancestor of X whose left child is also the ancestor of X. If x has no
right child, then x is the maximum node.


### Exercises 12.3-6
***
When node z in TREE-DELETE has two children, we could splice out its predecessor rather than its successor. 
Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better 
empirical performance. How might TREE-DELETE be changed to implement such a fair strategy?

### `Answer`

* Randomly choose one
* Assign each node with an attribute **height**, choose the higher one.
