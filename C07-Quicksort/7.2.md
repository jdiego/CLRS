### Exercises 7.2-1
***
Use the substitution method to prove that the recurrence T (n) = T (n - 1) + Θ(n) has the
solution T (n) = Θ(n^2), as claimed at the beginning of Section 7.2.

### `Answer`
T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n) = Θ(n) + Θ(n-1) + ... + Θ(1) = Θ(n^2)

### Exercises 7.2-2
***
What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array A have the same value?

### `Answer`
Θ(n^2)

If all elements are the same, the quicksort partition return index q = r. This means, the problem with size n
is reduced to one subproblem with size n-1. So the recurrence is T(n) = T(n-1) + n. By iteration method, 
<code>T(n) = Θ(n^2)</code>.
### Exercises 7.2-3
***
Show that the running time of QUICKSORT is Θ(n^2) when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order.

### `Answer`
Θ(n^2)

Similar to the above problem，because <code>T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n)</code>

In each partition, the pivot element is always the smallest element. Therefore, each partition will produce two
subarrays. The first subarray contains only one element - the smallest element - and this element is in its correct
position. The second subarray contains the remaining elements. Hence we can never achieve a balanced array in each recursive
step. In this case, the running time recurrence will be <code>T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n)</code>. Thus, <code>T(n) = Θ(n^2)</code>.


### Exercises 7.2-4
***
Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the transactions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in order by check number, and merchants usually cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Argue that the procedure INSERTION-SORT would tend to beat the procedure QUICKSORT on this problem.

### `Answer`

A simple intuitive argument will suffice here. The more sorted the original array is, the less work insertion 
sort will do. Namely, INSERTION-SORT is $\Theta(n + d)$, where $d$ is the number of inversions in the array. 
In the example above the number of inversions tends to be small so insertion sort will be close to linear.

On the other hand, if PARTITION does picks a pivot that does not participate in an inversion, it will 
produce and empty partition. Since there is a small number of inversions, QUICKSORT is very likely 
to produce empty partitions.


INSERTION-SORT’s running time on perfectly-sorted input runs in Θ(n) time. So, it takes almost Θ(n) 
running time to sort an almost-sorted input with INSERTION-SORT. However, QUICKSORT requires 
almost Θ(n^2) running time, recalling that it takes Θ(n^2) time to sort perfectly-sorted input. 
This is because when we pick the last element as the pivot, it is usually the biggest one, and it 
will produce one subproblem with close to n – 1 elements and one with 0 elements. Since the cost 
of PARTITION procedure of QUICKSORT is Θ(n), the recurrence running time of QUICKSORT is 
T(n) = T(n – 1) +Θ(n). In another problem, we, use the substitution method to prove that the 
recurrence T(n) = T(n – 1) + Θ(n) has the solution T(n) = Θ(n^2). So we use INSERTION-SORT rather 
than QUICKSORT in this situation when the input is almost sorted.

### Exercises 7.2-5
***
Suppose that the splits at every level of quicksort are in the proportion 1 - α to α, where 0 < α ≤ 1/2 is a constant. 
Show that the minimum depth of a leaf in the recursion tree is approximately - lg n/ lg α and the maximum depth is 
approximately -lg n/ lg(1 - α). (Don't worry about integer round-off.)

### `Answer`
First calculate the minimum height:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20n\\alpha^x%20\\le%201%20\\Rightarrow%20%20x%20\\ge%20\\log_{\\alpha}{\\frac{1}{n}}%20\\\\%20\\log_{\\alpha}{\\frac{1}{n}}%20%20=%20-\\log_{\\alpha}{n}%20=%20-\\frac{\\lg{n}}{\\lg{\\alpha}})

As for the maximum height, replace α with (1 - α)

The minimum depth corresponds to repeatedly taking the smaller subproblem, that is, the branch whose size is
proportional to alpha. Then, this will fall to 1 in k steps where 1 is approximately (α^k) * n. So, 
k is approximately log____ α(1/n) in the alpha base = - lg n/ lg α.

The longest depth corresponds to always taking the larger subproblem. We then have and identical expression,
replacing α with 1 - α : log_ {1-α}(1/n) = - lg(n)/lg(1-α).


### Exercises 7.2-6
***
Argue that for any constant 0 < α ≤ 1/2, the probability is approximately 1 - 2α that on a
random input array, PARTITION produces a split more balanced than 1-α to α.


### `Answer`
因为比1-α to α更好的分布的数的在他们之间，有1 - 2α的比例.比他们差的有α＋α ＝ 2α

The number better than [1-α,α] among them, and has a propotion 1 - 2α. So number worse than then is 2α
