### Exercises 7.3-1
***
Why do we analyze the average-case performance of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case performance?

### `Answer`

Because the worst case happen rarely, we want the average case to be fine.

### Exercises 7.3-2
***
During the running of the procedure RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, how many calls are made to the random-number generator 
RANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of Θ-notation.

### `Answer`

Let N(n) be the number of calls to Random when running randomized-quicksort on an array with size n. Let's try to
define N(n) recursively. Two extreme cases to consider as follows:

case 1 - The best - always partition into two subproblems with equal size:  
<code> N(n) = 2N(n/2) + 1, and N(n) = Θ(n) - by master theorem </code>

case 2 - The worst - always partition into one subproblem with one less element: 
<code> N(n) = N(n-1) + 1 = Θ(n). </code>

<code> 
N(0) = 1;
N(1) = N(0) + 1 = 1 + 1
N(2) = N(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 
N(3) = N(2) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
N(n) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ... 
N(n) = n**** * 1 = n = Θ(n). 
</code>
