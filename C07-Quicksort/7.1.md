### Exercises 7.1-1
***
Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A = [13, 19, 3, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11].

### Exercises 7.1-2
***
What value of q does PARTITION return when all elements in the array A[p...r] have the same value? Modify PARTITION so that q = (p+r)/2 when all elements in the array A[p...r] have the same value.

### `Answer`
If all elements in the array have the same value, the if test on the analogue of line 4 is 
thus successful when all entries are equal, in that case the value of k when the for loop 
terminates is k = r-1, so the value of q returned is q = k+1 = r.
So we have to modify the code in case the worst situation.

To make PARTITION return  q = floor((p+r)/2) when all elements have the same value,
modify line 4 of the algorithm to say this: if A[j] <= x and j % 2 == (p + 1) % 2.
This cause the algorithm to treat half of the instances of the same value to count
as less than, and the other half to count as greater than.

Another approach is presented into the following code

[code](./exercise_code/quicksort.py)

### Exercises 7.1-3
***
Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n is Î˜(n).

### `Answer`
Because we just iterate the array once.

### Exercises 7.1-4
***
How would you modify QUICKSORT to sort into nonincreasing order?

### `Answer`
Change the condition **A[j] <= x** to **A[j] >= x**
