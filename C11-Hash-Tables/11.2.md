### Exercises 11.2-1
***
Suppose we use a hash function h to hash n distinct keys into an array T of length m. Assuming simple uniform hashing, 
what is the expected number of collisions? More precisely, what is the expected cardinality of {{k, l} : k ≠ l and h(k) = h(l)}?

***
Demonstrate the insertion of the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table with collisions resolved by chaining. Let the table have 9 slots, and let the hash function be h(k) = k mod 9.

### Exercises 11.2-3
***
Professor Marley hypothesizes that substantial performance gains can be obtained if we modify the chaining scheme so that each list is kept in sorted order. How does the professor's modification affect the running time for successful searches, unsuccessful searches, insertions, and deletions?

### `Answer`
If the linked lists maintained by hash chaining are not kept sorted, insertion can be done in constant time 
by appending to the beginning of a list or at the end of a list. Searches are done by scanning a list, which 
has on expectation a length of n/m.

Successful searches are on expectation n/(2m) (which is the average of all possible successful search times: 
1, 2, . . . , n/m), whereas unsuccessful searches always require scanning the entire list, which is on expectation n/m. 
Once a key is found, deletion is constant time.

On the other hand, if we need to maintain linked lists that are sorted by key, insertion will take more time, 
as the linked lists need to be traversed until the correct position is found for the key we are trying to insert. 
Assuming that the keys are uniformly distributed, it is equally likely that the key will be inserted in any 
position in the linked list. So by the same argument as for successful searches in an unsorted list, an 
insertion into a sorted linked list takes on expectation n/(2m) steps. Searches and deletions take the same 
amount of time whether the lists are sorted or not, because the same algorithm is used. In particular, 
we cannot speed up searches, say using a binary search because we are using a linked list rather than 
an array. Overall, maintaining sorted linked lists slows insertions from worst case constant time to (n/2m)
time on expectation, while offering no improvement in searches and deletions.

* successful searches: No effect. We can't apply the binary search algorithm
* unsuccessful searches:No effect.
* insertions: The insertion operation earlier took O(1) because each time a new key was added to the head of the list. 
                But now it would take O(l) where l = length of the list.
* deletions:As long as list is doubly linked list, it should still take O(1) time to delete an element from the table. 
But if it is singly linked list then it would take O(l) whether or not the list is sorted. Where l = length of the list.

### Exercises 11.2-4
***
Suggest how storage for elements can be allocated and deallocated within the hash table itself by linking all unused slots into a free list. Assume that one slot can store a flag and either one element plus a pointer or two pointers. All dictionary and free-list operations should run in O(1) expected time. Does the free list need to be doubly linked, or does a singly linked free list suffice?

### `Answer`
需要双链表.每个slot有一个标识标识是否已分配，如果没有分配指针指向free list的属于自己的那个位置. 删除的时候将标志位清一下，将自己加入链表头，指针指向头;插入时根据指针去取.

### Exercises 11.2-5
***
Show that if |U| > nm, there is a subset of U of size n consisting of keys that all hash to the
same slot, so that the worst-case searching time for hashing with chaining is Θ(n).


### `Answer`
如果|U| ＝ nm，假设U的全集要均匀分到m个位置上，每个位置期望就有n个元素，因此至少有一个位置是有至少n个元素的，我们选取这个集合，查找操作需要的时间就是Θ(n).
